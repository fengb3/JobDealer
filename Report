### Abstract:
This report presents an overview of JobDealer, a solution designed to address the challenges in the job seeking and hiring process. The problem is outlined, followed by the approach to solving it, examples of the user interface, advanced techniques employed in the project, and suggestions for future work and enhancements.

### 1. Introduction
   JobDealer is a project aimed at solving the problem of inefficiencies and communication barriers in the job seeking and hiring process. In today's competitive job market, job seekers often struggle to get timely responses to their applications, while employers face challenges in finding the right candidates. The solution, JobDealer, is designed to create an intuitive platform for job seekers and employers to connect, communicate, and exchange information efficiently.

### 2. Design and Approach
   To tackle the aforementioned problem, the following design and approach were employed:

- Module 1: Job Post Browsing
  Description: This module allows job seekers to browse and search for job posts within the app.
  Implementation: Two sets of user interfaces and interaction logic were developed using SwiftUI for efficient app building. Data is stored on a server, with the client-side app communicating with it.

- Module 2: Job Seeker Browsing
  Description: This module allows employers to browse and search for job seekers within the app.
  Implementation: Similar to Module 1, SwiftUI was used for efficient UI development and communication was established between the client-side app and server.

- Module 3: Chat
  Description: This module provides a chat interface for both parties to communicate and exchange files, such as resumes.
  Implementation: The server-side was developed using .NET and the SignalR framework was utilized for real-time data exchange, enabling chat functionality. The WebApi was used for data management.
